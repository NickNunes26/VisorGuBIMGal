//! A fast keyed hash for maps whose keys come from the file: coordinates and record ids.
//!
//! The standard library's SipHash is slow for keys this small. Its keys are also no secret in
//! WebAssembly, which has no randomness of its own, so they are the same on every run. This is
//! NH, the universal hash of UMAC, with a fixed finish: each 64-bit word of the key has its two
//! halves added to a secret and multiplied together, and the products are summed. For two keys
//! of the same length the sums are equal with probability at most 2⁻³², whatever the keys, as
//! long as the secret is random and unknown, so a file cannot choose ids or coordinates that
//! land in one bucket. The host sets the secret from a real random source with [`set_secret`].
//! Code may only look values up through these maps, never walk them, so the secret cannot
//! change the output.
